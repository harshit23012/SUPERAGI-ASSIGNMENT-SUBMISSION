## Question 2

To answer this question, we need to analyze the click-through rates (CTRs) of the email templates using a statistical method, often a hypothesis test, to determine if the differences in CTRs are statistically significant. In this case, we are looking for a 95% confidence level in our conclusions.

First, let's summarize the data:

Template A: 10% CTR

Template B: 7% CTR

Template C: 8.5% CTR

Template D: 12% CTR

Template E: 14% CTR

For each template, we need to test whether its CTR is significantly different from that of the control template (A) with 95% confidence. This is commonly done using a chi- square test or a z-test for proportions.


Let's calculate this using a z-test for proportions for each template compared to A:

1. The z-score can be calculated using the formula: 


	$
z=\frac{p_{1}-p_{2}}{\sqrt{p(1-p)(\frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}})}}
$

$p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are the CTRs of the two templates being compared.
p is the pooled proportion, $p = \frac{(x_{1} + x_{2})}/{(n_{1} + n_{2})}$ where $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are the number of clicks for each template, and $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the number of emails sent for each template. 
$n_{1} = n_{2} = 1000$ in this scenario. 

2. Once we calculate the z-score, we compare it to the critical value for a 95% confidencelevel, which is approximately 1.96 for a two-tailed test. Then calculating the z-scores for templates B, C, D, and E compared to template A. 

The calculated z-scores for each template compared to template A are as follows: 
Template B vs. A: -2.41 
Template C vs. A: -1.16 
Template D vs. A: 1.43 
Template E vs. A: 2.75 

The critical z-value for a 95% confidence level in a two-tailed test is approximately $\pm 1.96$ If the absolute value of a z-score is greater than 1.96, the difference in CTRs isstatistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

Based on this:

Template B (z-score = -2.41) is significantly worse than A.

Template C (z-score = -1.16) is not significantly different from A at this confidence level.

Template D (z-score = 1.43) is not significantly different from A at this confidence level.

Template E (z-score = 2.75) is significantly better than A.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is:

"Template E is better than A with over 95% confidence, Template B is worse than A with over 95% confidence. We need to run the test for longer to tell where C and D compare to A with 95% confidence." 

So, option $(b)$ is correct.
