## Question 4

To evaluate the potential accuracy of Classifier V2 under each of the proposed training data scenarios, we will examine the implications of each approach:

1. Approach 1 (10k Stories Closest to Decision Boundary): Selecting stories where the V1 classifier's output is closest to the decision boundary can be particularly effective for improving the classifier's performance on ambiguous cases. This method tends to select examples that the current model is most uncertain about, potentially leading to a more nuanced understanding of the boundary between the two categories. However, this method might not expose the classifier to a diverse set of clear-cut examples, which are also important for generalization.

2. Approach 2 (10k Random Labeled Stories): This approach provides a broad and potentially diverse set of examples from the target news sources. Random sampling is likely to capture a wide range of stories, including both clear-cut and borderline cases across different styles and contents. This diversity can be beneficial for the overall generalization of the model, making it more adaptable to a variety of texts.

3. Approach 3 (10k Stories Where V1 is Most Wrong): Selecting stories where the V1 classifier is not only wrong but also farthest from the decision boundary can help in identifying and correcting the most significant errors of the current model. This method focuses on the hardest cases where V1 is most confidently incorrect. While this can greatly improve the model's performance on these specific types of errors, it might not provide a balanced view of the more typical or borderline cases.


In terms of ranking these methods based on potential accuracy improvement for V2, it would likely be as follows:

1. Approach 2 (Random Sampling): This method is likely to yield the highest improvement in accuracy for V2. The key reason is its potential for high diversity in the training data, covering a wide range of examples that the model might encounter in real-world scenarios.

2. Approach 1 (Closest to Decision Boundary): This approach is focused on refining the decision boundary and is likely to improve accuracy, especially in more ambiguous cases. However, it might not provide as broad a view of the data as random sampling.

3. Approach 3 (Most Confidently Wrong Cases): While this method helps in correcting the most glaring errors of V1, its focus on extreme cases might limit the overall generalization capabilities of V2. It is very useful for improving specific weaknesses of V1 but may not contribute as much to overall accuracy across a diverse set of news stories.

It's important to note that the best approach can also depend on the existing strengths and weaknesses of V1. If V1 already performs well on typical cases but struggles with borderline examples, Approach 1 might be more valuable. Conversely, if V1 has significant blind spots or systematic errors proach 3 could be more beneficial.
